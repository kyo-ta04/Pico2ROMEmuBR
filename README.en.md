# Pico2ROMEmu
![Pico2ROMEmuBR](./IMG/Pico2ROMEmuBR_title_img.jpg)
This project is a simple and fast ROM emulator using Raspberry Pi Pico2 (the binary is for Super AKI-80).

## Features
- The main component is just a Pico2, and it's fast (Z80 10MHz no wait states!).
- This is exclusively for Raspberry Pi Pico2 (RP2350), not for Pico (RP2040). Absolutely not.
- It's a crazy device that directly connects Pico2 (3.3v power) and Super AKI-80 (Z80-based SBC, 5v power). (If you don't understand what this means, please ask someone knowledgeable).
- ROM emulation is 8kByte, ROM-BASIC. It also has a reset output (open collector), clock output 20MHz (for TMPZ84C015: Z80 10MHz operation), UART-USB conversion, and power supply (5V) function.
- Super AKI-80 can be operated with this one unit with minimal parts and no modification.
- This is an experimental project that also serves as training for RP2350's PIO, multi-core, UART-USB conversion, GPIO, etc.
- A PCB has been created -> [Pico2ROMEmuPCB](./Pico2ROMEmuPCB/README.md)

## Structure
- The ROM-BASIC part such as `rom_basic_const.c` is derived from [saki80basic](https://vintagechips.wordpress.com/2025/04/24/saki80basic/).
  - The original [BASIC subset](http://searle.x10host.com/cpm/index.html) was created by Mr. Grant Searle, and was ported and improved for the Super AKI-80 by @vintagechip (Dennou Densetsu).
  - Please refer to the respective licenses for details.
- The RP2350 PIO ROM emulation part is based on @tendai22plus's [ROM emulation](https://github.com/tendai22/emuz80_pico2/blob/main/doc/ROM_EMULATION.md) (or rather, it's almost the same ðŸ’¦).
